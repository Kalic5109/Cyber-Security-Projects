These are the projects undertaken as part of the 2023 Monash cybersecurity bootcamp.

Please note if you are doing a similar course and come across these same units, while I do not mind if you use some of the information contained if my co-contributors and I are credited I do discourage the use of all of it as you wonâ€™t learn anything from copying work.<br>
There are also plagiarism scanners when you upload your submission.

Project 1 is Creating a load balanced cloud application hosting a web-app set up as a blog.<br>
<details>
  Description is as follows - "In the first project week, students will build, secure, and protect a cloud application that hosts their own cyber blog. This 
  project will result in tangible deliverables that demonstrate their knowledge of cloud, cloud security, networking, web development, cryptography, and 
  network security."
  <br>
  In addition to this I learnt IaC using terraform to create the cloud app in azure. Within this I also edited the JavaScript that was hosting the webapp to add 
  in the expandable see more section.

Project 2 is a CTF style attack on a fictional company that covers a Web-app, a Linux server and a Windows server.<br>
<br>
<details>
 <br>
  Description is as follows - "On Day 1, you'll attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. 
  On Day 2, you'll exploit the organization's   Linux servers, and on Day 3, you'll exploit the organization's Windows servers.<br>
  The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that you exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are   
  worth   various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.'<br>
  You will summarize your findings and recommended mitigations in a penetration testing summary report. A framework for the report will be provided. This report 
1`
  This covered a host of techniques in metasploit that were used for each vulnerability in the report as well as Mitre Att&ck navigator for the final product. <br>
  While this was more a test of report writing we did find a considerable number of flags, but the web-app is a place that I will need to strengthen my attacks for in   my free time. <br>
  This was a group project, so I need to credit Nishant Thiruvakadu and Chris Kimitsis as they contributed to the findings and the finished product.

Project 3 is creating a monitoring environment to defend a fictional company from a suspected incoming attack.<br>
<br>
<details>
 <br>
  Description is as follows - "This week, you will work in groups to use the skills that you've learned in the Defensive Security unit and design a custom 
  monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization, VSI. 
 <br>
  On Day 1, you'll use Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for the fictional organization. On Day 2, you'll determine whether that monitoring 
  solution will protect the organization from several simulated attacks. On Day 3, you'll showcase your defensive project with a group presentation to the class. <br>
  This Module was focusing on creating the dashboard, alerts and reports from the ground up as well as interpreting the data individually. <br>
  Then once we had created the required visualizations we could introduce several of our choosing for the Windows dashboard and the Apache Dashboard.<br> 
  If was a good method to show that what you THINK might be a good visualization is not a very clear indicator of data and sometimes a line graph just works better. <br>
  This one will be in 2 parts, including a slideshow presentation as well as a written report.<br>
  Again this was also a group project so I must credit Chris Kimitsis for his contributions.<br>

 Project 4 is currently underway and will be uploaded when complete and submitted.
