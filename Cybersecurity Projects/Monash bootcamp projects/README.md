These are the projects undertaken as part of the 2023 Monash cybersecurity bootcamp.
<br>
<br>
Project 1 is Creating a load balanced cloud application hosting a web-app set up as a blog.
<details>
 <br>
  Description is as follows - "In the first project week, students will build, secure, and protect a cloud application that hosts their own cyber blog. This project     will result in tangible deliverables that demonstrate their knowledge of cloud, cloud security, networking, web development, cryptography, and network security."
    <br>
    In addition to this I learnt IaC using terraform to create the cloud app in azure.

Project 2 is a CTF style attack on a fictional company that covers a Web-app, a Linux server and a Windows server.
<details>
 <br>
  Description is as follows - "On Day 1, you'll attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. On Day 2, you'll exploit the organization's   Linux servers, and on Day 3, you'll exploit the organization's Windows servers.<br>
  The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that you exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are worth   various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.'<br>
  You will summarize your findings and recommended mitigations in a penetration testing summary report. A framework for the report will be provided. This report will   be your final project deliverable."<br>
  This covered a host of techniques in metasploit that were used for each vulnerability in the report as well as Mitre Att&ck navigator for the final product. <br>
  While this was more a test of report writing we did find a conciderable amount of flags but the web-app is a place that i will need to strengthen my attacks for in   my free time. <br>
  This was a group project so I need to credit Nishant Thiruvakadu and Chris Kimitsis as they contributed to the findings and the end product.
